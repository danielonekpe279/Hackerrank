         Jim is off to a party and is searching for a matching pair of socks. His drawer is filled with socks, each pair of a different color. 
         In its worst case scenario, how many socks (x) should Jim remove from his drawer until he finds a matching pair?
         Explanation
            Case 1 : A pair of socks are present, hence exactly 2 draws for the socks to match.
            Case 2 : 2 pair of socks are present in the drawer. The first and the second draw might result in 2 socks of different color.
            The 3rd sock picked will definitely match one of previously picked socks. Hence, 3.
